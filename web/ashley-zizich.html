        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I am currently working at a public library as a Children's Services Specialist. I wish to continue to work in
            a public library in the children's department. I also wish to incorporate community outreach and gain
            community partners.
            <br>In my free time I volunteer in my community by working the the Conservation Committee.
            I am dedicated to ecology and the environment by teaching youth the importance of the ecosystem around
            them.</b>
